All my various settings

### Installation ###

1. Run the following in your shell - INSTALL_DIR can be changed if desired (defaults to ~/.smj10j/DevEnvironment)
   ```export INSTALL_DIR=; curl -s https://bitbucket.org/smj10j/devenvironment/raw/e6829c9aeea0ef987ab78c406d19d0dd1deb1df2/install/install.sh | /bin/bash```
2. That's it!
